The length of the human SOD2 protein is 222 amino acids and the subcellular localisation is mitochondrion matrix.
Interpretation:It plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative damage.

The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results is from 58.1% to 100%. 
Interpretation: This suggests that while SOD2 is highly conserved in some organisms, there is also notable divergence in others.

The alignment score between mouse_SOD2 and human_SOD2 is 1097 and the percentage identity is 90.09%
Interpretation: This indicates strong sequence similarity and suggests that these two proteins are highly conserved, reflecting their close evolutionary relationship and possibly similar functional roles in their respective species.

The alignment score between mouse_SOD2 and random_SOD2 is -222 and the percentage identity is 6.31%
The alignment score between human_SOD2 and random_SOD2 is -229 and the percentage identity is 7.21%
Interpretation:This confirms that the random sequences are not biologically related and supports the reliability of the alignment results.

The mouse_SOD2 and human_SOD2 are most closely related.
