The problems identified in Weeks 3 to 5 mainly stemmed from a lack of sufficient comments in my code, which led to confusion and conflicts during the coding process. Additionally, there were some issues with user input functionalityâ€”users were unable to input variables as intended. Furthermore, my plots had overlapping elements, making them unclear. I have since revised the plots to make them more readable and visually refined, ensuring that the reflections are clearer.
